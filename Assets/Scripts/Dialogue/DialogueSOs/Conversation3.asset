  dialogue:
  - King Arthur.
  - Hugo, what have you been up to? Have you been going around my castle killing
    my men?
  - I did not. They subject themselves to death from the moment they pledge themselves
    to a tyrant like you.
  - You ungrateful child! How dare you act like this after all I have done for you!
  - 'You have done nothing but brought sorrow to me and my family. '
  - What family? You don't have one!
  - And that is because of you! You took my mother forcefully and killed my father!
  - What..? I didn't know he had a child. I will be happy to give you the same fate
    as your father then.
  - I will kill you myself.
